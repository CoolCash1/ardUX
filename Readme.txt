This is a project I designd in my free time, Its pourpose is to create a simple and fake computer out of an arduino
and some devices. You can connect and control multiple devices such as piezo speakers and servo's as of the lastest
release. the setup is easy and the wire mapping is listed in the readme for alpha R7(ardUX/alpha/R7/ReadMe.h). The
interface LCD Interface is meant to reseamble some sort of linux terminal, You send commands via the serial Monitor
and they will be responded to, a list of the avalible commands is in the readme for the version you are using.
